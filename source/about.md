Hi! I'm Shi Qiu [`/ʃɜː tʃjoʊ/`, (`shirt without rt`) (`chew-yo`)] and thank you for visiting my blog!

I am a Master of Engineering student in Computer Science & Applications at [Virginia Tech](https://cs.vt.edu/), based in Washington Metropolitan Area, with an expected graduation in May 2026.

My academic and personal projects focus on software engineering. You may find my public projects listed [here](/projects).

Before graduate school, I worked as a Game Development Engineer at Tencent. I focused on porting and optimizing PC games to mobile platforms, refactoring core modules and building CI/CD and asset indexing pipelines.

My favourite programming languages are (in order of preference): Python, C++, C#, TypeScript and JavaScript.

Outside of programming, I like collecting and tinkering with tech gadgets, Nintendo games and going on road trips. My most recent hobby is 3D printing, I hope I can have something to share in my blog soon<sup>TM</sup> (if I haven't posted anything about it yet).

Welcome, and enjoy!
